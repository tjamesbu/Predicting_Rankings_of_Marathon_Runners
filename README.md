# PREDICTING RANKINGS OF MARATHON RUNNERS

I am including this course in my projects because it was setup as a project and competition. Students had to work individually to develop a machine learning pipeline that can accurately develop predictions.  

The goal of this project was to take a set of raw marathon data, collected from multiple marathons, and run it through data-cleaning, feature engineering, a train-holdout-test split, OneHotEncoding, and a machine-learning pipeline to predict the placing-sequence of marathon runners during the next marathon. Percent error was measured afterwards to measure accuracy of the model.  

Lesson learned from this project was how easily overfitting can be induced in multiple parts of the project, how OneHotEncoders can be used to transform text data into numerical data, and how Transformed Target Regressors can be used to produce the inverse sequence of the results.
